# 3D Cave Runner - Unity-Android Example Project

This repo contains an example of the 3D Cave Runner game with Skillz integration. The purpose of this example is to show how to integrate an Unity-Android game with the Skillz Platform .

This project is setup to work with the latest version of the Skillz Android SDK, which can be found at https://skillz.com/developer/downloads. Once the SDK is downloaded, the Skillz embedded framework will need to be added to the project.

The Installation for this project was divided into 3 major steps: [Installing the Skillz framework](https://github.com/skillz/3d-cave-runner/commit/be9d6f1cf60d0981bbe29b6933448dd74d1e3bc7),[Implementing Core Skillz](https://github.com/skillz/3d-cave-runner/commit/c3c7f168fd30c4de2423c8da6aa83fdad340fa98), and [Implementing Skillz Fairness](https://github.com/skillz/3d-cave-runner/commit/2c8db0cc15489042293640e1aa9fbe093f24ae6e).

### Skillz example instructions <br />
Step 1: This [commit](https://github.com/skillz/3d-cave-runner/commit/be9d6f1cf60d0981bbe29b6933448dd74d1e3bc7) completed the [Installing the Skillz framework ](https://cdn.skillz.com/doc/developer/unity/android/integrate_skillz_sdk/install_framework/) step of the Skillz Integration.

* This step adds the framework to the project and configures the project to link with the Skillz framework.<br /><br />

Step 2: This [commit](https://github.com/skillz/3d-cave-runner/commit/c3c7f168fd30c4de2423c8da6aa83fdad340fa98) completed the [Implementing Core Skillz Functions](https://cdn.skillz.com/doc/developer/unity/android/integrate_skillz_sdk/install_framework/) step of the Skillz Integration.

* This step integrates the Skillz platform with the project and will add multiplayer tournaments using the Skillz API.<br /><br />

Step 3: This [commit](https://github.com/skillz/3d-cave-runner/commit/2c8db0cc15489042293640e1aa9fbe093f24ae6e) completed the [Implementing Skillz Fairness](https://cdn.skillz.com/doc/developer/unity/android/integrate_skillz_sdk/install_framework/) step of the Skillz Integration.

* This step ensures that the players' games are fair by implementing a consistent random number generation.<br /><br />
